Equal Weight S&P 500 Screener:
With a $10,000,000 portfolio, calcuting the most profitable stocks within the limitations of the S&P 500 for the best purchase at an Equal Weight meausrement. Using a basic tutorial I expanded on it for use with a newer version of IEX Cloud API. As well as, the use of XlsxWriter to streamline the excel creation process in my code. 

2021-2022 Year NHL Betting Ratio:
Using Hockey-Reference.com I calcualated the Ridge Regression of the W/L % of each team in the NHL to determing best bets of the year. This was calculated using Goals and goal differences. A higher regression was the likely hood of the team winning overall in the league. When checking with the actual winner of the Colorado Avalanche, my team chosen with my data was the Tampa Bay Lightning by a small deviation. Going forward I will add more historic data and datapoints to develop this further as well as incorporate more sports organizations for testing. With my original test file I used XlsxWriter to transfer the data between a .txt file to a .csv and when calculated made a specific file for my python code.
